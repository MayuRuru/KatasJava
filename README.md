* SOLID principles for Clean Code
* Object Oriented Programming (OPP) principles: Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism

### ⚒️ Tech Stack & Tools:
* JAVA
* Spring Boot 
* Intellij IDEA

## 🎺 3 - Die Bremer Stadtmusikanten Kata:
The Bremen Town Musicians are a choir of little animals that are left to sing together.
* Cats should be started with a name and a sound they usually sing.
* At first cats don't sing.
* We can tell any cat to start singing and also to stop singing.
* Cats tell us when they sing with a function returning:
“The cat {name} is singing {sound}” and when they don't they will tell us “the cat {name} doesn't want to sing".
* The donkey and all the animals can do the same as the cat but tehir messages are: 
“The donkey {name} is singing {sound}” and when not “The donkey {name} does not want to sing”.
* To direct the choir there is a director who has the ability to make several animals sing at the same time. 
* We will instantiate this director with a list of animals and it must have the capacity of:
(startSing() and stopSing()) functions in which the animals must start and stop singing regardless of their type or the number of participants.
